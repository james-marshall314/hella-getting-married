          The ceremony and reception will be taking place outside, in Los Angeles, in September, so it could be quite warm. We’ll also be dancing well into the evening, however, and it can get quite cold at night in Topanga. So the dress code is basically “look good, don’t stress too much, but don’t show up in a t-shirt.”

        <p>
          The most convenient hotels are in Woodland Hills, right at the base of the canyon, where we will be providing shuttle drop-off service the night of the wedding. There are quite a few options to choose from, covering a range of budgets and levels of luxury. We would recommend staying at one of these options (all near each other), but feel free to hoe your own row, as it were.

           We will be providing a shuttle drop-off service to the recommended hotels after our reception. For the trip TO the ceremony, we recommend Uber/Lyft, which are both quite affordable in LA and will happily take you into the canyon. Kieffer would prefer you take Lyft instead of Uber, just because they’re a little bit less soul-crushingly evil, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

          <p>
            You can also drive to the ceremony, but we will have limited street parking, and much of it will be taken up by vendors, immediate family, and a drop off zone for the shuttle. More importantly, folks often get drunk at weddings, and it is really not okay to drive drunk in Topanga. Obviously it is not okay to drive drunk anywhere, but after even one or two drinks the canyon can get very dangerous. Please, please do not drive to our wedding if you plan to drink at all.

      <h2 class="sub-head">Our Story</h2>
      <div class="the-story">
        <div class="info">
          <h4>Meet cute...</h4>
          <p>
            Bailey and Kieffer met in 2007, when they were both freshmen at Colorado College, whereupon she promptly and justifiably decided she disliked him quite a bit. They spent the next three and a half years sharing a large group of mutual friends, saying hi to each other at the dining hall or parties, and otherwise having nothing at all to do with each other. After Kieffer did quite a bit of growing up, including a year off from school and a semester in Greece, they got to talking during the second semester of Bailey’s senior year and the rest, as they say, was history. Sort of.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
          <h4>Smooth sailing...</h4>
          <p>
            First, they had to make it through a full year of Bailey traveling the world while Kieffer stayed behind in Colorado Springs to finish up college. Finally, Kieffer had to convince Bailey to betray every bit of her gentle nature and outdoorsy upbringing and move to New York City with him. Since then, leaving aside unemployment, illnesses in the family, underemployment, late night trips to the emergency room, over-employment, and the occasional vicious mauling by domestic cat, things have been mostly calm.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
          <h4>What comes next...</h4>
          <p>
            After three and a half years in NYC, Kieffer finally realized that it wasn’t ever going to get any better than this. Despite going ring shopping together, he managed to surprise Bailey by proposing in LA during Thanksgiving, 2015 (The story of how it all went down is super cute and really meaningful, too. You should ask someone about it). Now, they’re getting ready to take the next big steps in their lives as a team. Bailey is about to finish a master’s degree in biotechnology and public health, and wants to continue working in cancer research. Kieffer recently started working freelance as a marketing consultant to give himself time to pursue writing and have more control over his life. Together, they are planning a move back to the west coast shortly before the wedding. What the future holds for these two and the cats they treat like actual human babies remains to be seen, but if we can learn anything from the story so far, it’s likely to be uneventful, unexciting, and proceed exactly as planned.
