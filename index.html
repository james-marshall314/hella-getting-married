            The ceremony and reception will both be outdoors, and September in LA can be quite warm. However, temperatures in the Canyon drop quite a bit when the sun goes down, so bringing a layer is a good call. As for how fancy you should be, all we want is for you to look good, not stress too much, and not show up in a t-shirt.

      <div class="lodging">
        <p>
          We will be providing shuttle drop-off service to the hotels below on the night of the wedding. We would recommend staying at one of these options (all near each other), but feel free to hoe your own row, as it were. There are quite a few other choices in Woodland Hills, the neighborhood at the base of the canyon.
        </p>
        <p>If you prefer a less traditional hospitality experience, <a href="media-left media-middle" href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Topanga--CA?checkin=09%2F16%2F2016&checkout=09%2F18%2F2016&price_max=305&zoom=13&search_by_map=true&sw_lat=34.05994961927086&sw_lng=-118.63038819659914&ne_lat=34.146719858401866&ne_lng=-118.56670182574953&ss_id=1i6qralm" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> is particularly good in Topanga. However, there will be another wedding in the canyon that weekend, so if you do decide to go this route we would recommend booking as quickly as possible.</p>

           We will be providing a shuttle drop-off service to the recommended hotels after our reception. For the trip TO the ceremony, we recommend Uber/Lyft, which are both quite affordable in LA and will happily take you into the canyon. Kieffer would prefer you take Lyft instead of Uber, just because they’re a little bit less soul-crushingly evil, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You can also drive to the ceremony, but we will have limited street parking, and much of it will be taken up by vendors, immediate family, and a drop off zone for the shuttle. More importantly, folks often get drunk at weddings, and it is really not okay to drive drunk in Topanga. Obviously it is not okay to drive drunk anywhere, but the canyon gets very dangerous, even if you've only had 1 or 2 drinks. Please, please do not drive to our wedding if you plan to drink at all.

      <div class="the-story">
        <div class="info">
          <h4>Love At First Sight...</h4>
          <p>
            Bailey and Kieffer met in 2007, when they were both freshmen at Colorado College, whereupon she promptly and justifiably decided she disliked him quite a bit. They spent the next three and a half years sharing a large group of mutual friends, saying hi to each other at the dining hall or parties, and otherwise having nothing at all to do with each other. After Kieffer did quite a bit of growing up, including a year off from school and a semester in Greece, they got to talking during the second semester of Bailey’s senior year and the rest, as they say, was history. Sort of.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
          <h4>Smooth sailing...</h4>
          <p>
            First, they had to make it through a full year of Bailey traveling the world while Kieffer finished up college in Colorado Springs. Next, Kieffer had to convince Bailey to betray every bit of her gentle nature and outdoorsy upbringing and move to New York City with him. Since then, leaving aside unemployment, illnesses in the family, underemployment, late night trips to the emergency room, over-employment, and the occasional vicious mauling by domestic cat, things have been mostly calm.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
          <h4>What comes next...</h4>
          <p>
            After three and a half years in NYC, Kieffer finally realized that it wasn’t ever going to get any better than this. Despite going ring shopping together, he managed to surprise Bailey by proposing in LA during Thanksgiving, 2015 (The story of how it all went down is super cute and really meaningful, too. You should ask someone about it). Now, they’re getting ready to take the next big steps in their lives as a team. Bailey is about to finish a master’s degree in biotechnology and public health, and wants to continue working in cancer research. Kieffer recently started working freelance as a marketing consultant to give himself time to pursue writing and have more control over his life. Together, they are planning a move back to the west coast shortly before the wedding. What the future holds for these two – and the cats they treat like actual human babies – remains to be seen, but judging from the story so far it’s likely to be uneventful, unexciting, and proceed exactly as planned.

                Jaya is Bailey’s sister, and effectively her other half. They have different interests, beliefs, and personalities, but that hasn’t kept them from being incredibly close, sharing secret games, languages, and understandings of the world since they were kids. Without her sister to keep her grounded, Bailey wouldn’t be the person she is today, and is quite frankly unsure the world could continue to exist at all. Jaya has always followed her passions, from visual arts and religious studies to beekeeping, and now works as an art teacher in Menlo Park. When she’s not teaching, or pursuing her own often fabric based art, she lives with boyfriend Tim, mother Pam, brother Rob and profoundly cute dog, Aiko.

                Sophie, more correctly known as Sofa, is technically Bailey’s cousin, but such a simple, non-compound word can’t capture the depth of their bond. Growing up, the two spent every summer together on Cape Cod, forming a consistently unstoppable duo as they played, sailed, supported, loved, learned, and caused trouble. They’ve always loved each other like siblings despite spending most of the year on separate coasts, a trend that annoyingly continues to this day. When Bailey moved east, Sofa moved west, and now lives with her fiancé Max in San Francisco, where she works at at a startup focused on using digital technology to make mental healthcare more accessible and affordable.

                Malka is Kieffer’s younger sister, which means she’s spent the last two decades being mercilessly teased and ferociously protected, depending on the needs of the situation. Over that time, she’s developed the attitude necessary to deal with such a clever brother, as well as a giant heart, a wicked sense of humor, and an impressive capacity for empathy. She was the first person to make Bailey feel like a welcome part of Kieffer’s family, taking care of her future sister with a degree of grace and understanding far beyond her years. She takes similar care with her photography, preferring to work with film and develop it herself, a practice she is currently studying at Montana State.

                Sonja and Bailey met their first week at Colorado College, brought together by the forces that drive all socializing at the start of freshman year: geography, schedule, and mutual acquaintances. They found each other thanks to Bailey’s roommate, Abby, who helpfully laid the foundation for the towering monument of friendship the two have built. They were inseparable for the next four years, sharing road trips, bike rides, feelings, and the occasional rescue from a locked basement kitchen. Sonja radiates positivity, and is always there to help balance Bailey and keep her grounded on life’s many journeys. Sonja, an artist, yoga teacher, and free spirit, lives in Richmond, Virginia, where she is training to guide new lives into the world as a nurse midwife.

                Pam and Bailey became best friends as they bonded over soccer and pre-calculus at the heights of their teenage-hood, and since the day Pam kicked down a door to rescue her from a locked train bathroom, Bailey has understood that a best friend with so much love, loyalty and willingness to act was too precious to ever let go of. That’s what helped them remain so close despite the geographical challenges that ensued when Pam followed her passion into the Peace Corps after graduating college. She currently lives in Oakland, works in breast cancer research, and runs triathlons to help satisfy her voracious appetite for challenge and growth. Bailey cannot wait to live near Pamela again.

                Becca and Bailey met in college, brought together by mutual friends who realized the two shared the capability to have goofy, off-kilter fun without taking themselves too seriously. In between cuddling, struggling together to understand life’s mysteries – particularly boys – and doing pajama-clad dance routines, the two realized their playful sense of humor and compassionate empathy had permanently cemented their friendship. Becca’s ability to balance her ambition and intellect with her inherent silliness enhances life’s high points, and makes her a beacon of hope during the lows. She currently works in immigration law in Chicago, and has her eye on law school in the next few years.

Their shared passion for biology and ecology lead to many adventurous block break trips, and long hours chasing owls through the forest at night. Julia’s witty quips, steadfast loyalty, and warm heart can currently be found in San Diego, CA, where she works as a senior biologist for an environmental consulting firm.

                Devon and Bailey became friends their senior year of college, but the bond between the two truly blossomed after they’d both moved to New York. Devon’s unique ability to bring people together makes her a natural hostess, and many of her parties ended with the two girls talking long into the night. Those same parties gave rise to a tight-knit Brooklyn family, of which both Bailey and Kieffer are lucky to be members. Devon is currently pursuing a graduate degree in food studies, and spends her time laughing, running marathons, and cooking elaborate meals with her friends.

                Aly and Kieffer met in the climbing gym during his freshman year. She was a transfer student looking for friends; he was arrogantly convinced the two years he’d taken off made him better than his classmates. They soon discovered a shared love of talking too fast, having too many opinions, withering stares, and wearing really tight pants. Needless to say, their friendship blossomed quickly, and although they’re both much nicer than they were 9 years ago, they remain as close as ever. Having finally given into the part of her that was meant to live in southern California, Aly is currently pursuing a PhD in Immunology at Cedars Sinai.

                Ben and Kieffer met their freshman year of college through a series of mutual friends and shared interests, and that is definitely the 100% true story of how it went down no matter what anyone else says. The next year, Kieffer saved Ben from his horrible draw in the housing lottery, and while they were only roommates for ¾ of a semester the bond they forged in that brief time has proven unbreakable. Not unshakeable, mind you; Ben and Kieffer have almost broken up at least 6 times since they started hanging out, but like most long-term relationships, the issues tend to stem only from poor communication. Ben currently lives in Brooklyn, NY, where he is finally putting his otherworldly talent, charisma, and drive to work as a budding rock star.

                Cam and Kieffer should never really have become friends. In fact, if it weren’t for a series of absurd coincidences, Cam would have just been the guy who worked at the liquor store, and Kieffer would have just been the clearly underage idiot who thought he knew way more about craft beer than he actually did. Instead, they discovered a common worldview, overlapping tastes, and simple desire to learn that lead to a truly surprising friendship. So while Kieffer and Cam getting to know each other at all was shocking, that they remain friends seems incredibly obvious. Cam now lives in Brooklyn, and works full time making sure the computers at the New York Genome Center work well enough to analyze genetic data.

                Devon is Bailey’s oldest friend, a constant companion since their days of running barefoot around the Peninsula School. Being raised in the same strange hippie community and enduring their mothers’ weird homeopathic remedies built such a strong foundation of shared experience that they’ve become essential and necessary parts of each others lives. Through the long hours they’ve shared, from drinking tea in his parents’ kitchen to passing time on endless late-night bus rides across Australia, Bailey has always felt like things made more sense once she said them to Devon. While he’s only recently come into Kieffer’s life, Devon’s generosity and openheartedness, as well as their shared horror at the digital era’s lack of privacy quickly brought the two together. Devon currently lives in San Francisco and works as an interaction designer at Location Labs, creating mobile apps to alleviate the unidentified problems in peoples lives.

                Natch and Kieffer became friends in much the same way Bailey and Kieffer fell in love; after spending a full four years glancing off each other like distracted bumper car drivers, they finally collided head on. Natch crashed on Kieffer’s couch after graduating from CC, and by the time he set out for the west coast less than a month later, the two were fast friends. Considering how necessary their relationship has shown itself to be over the intervening years it is a little terrifying to think they almost missed it entirely; there but for the grace of god go they, as it were. Natch is currently pursuing landscape architecture and carpentry in Brooklyn, where he regularly hosts dinner parties, teams up with Kieffer to smoke meat, and generally brings warmth to the lives of others.

                Nick and Kieffer met their freshman year of college. Nick is also the only groomsperson who wrote his own bio when asked, so here he is, in his own words: “When I met Kieffer, he was the cool kid, and I was the hippie that had non-jokingly posted "Life is all about the vibes" on Facebook scant months earlier. That said, I was surprised when we quickly became close friends. Turns out we both have a lot of feelings, overthink everything, and love whiskey. Since then, there have been very high highs and incredibly low lows, but through it all, Kieffer has been the closest thing I've ever had to a brother. I'd go into this more, but I'm getting teary-eyed in my office and it's ruining my lawyerly game face.”
                Nick lives in New York, where he works as an attorney, looks handsome in suits, and watches a ton of cartoons.

                Robert and Kieffer were both philosophy majors, in the same class for their first two blocks at CC, and share an interest in cultural commentary, cartoons, videogames, and the future. Fortunately, they also both took 5 years to graduate from college, because they didn’t really hang out much during the first four. However, when Robert graciously allowed Kieffer to move into his house for their fifth year, they quickly discovered what they’d been missing. Freed from the social pressures and oppressive sense of an imposing end that typically defines ones senior year, they essentially perfected college life, passing the days with a combination of water balloon fights, weightlifting, and conversation. After two years in NYC and one wandering the globe on a quest to become a Mongolian Eagle Hunter, Robert is now pursuing an MBA at UCLA.                 </p>

                Rob is Bailey’s younger brother, and thanks to his mom and two older sisters, is an extremely well trained young man. He’s also wise beyond his years; as a five-year-old, he helped Bailey decide what to wear to school, and has helped her put relationship problems into perspective well into her 20s. After years of healthy abuse at the hands of his sisters, Rob has become a mature, funny, and incredibly kind person. And while his love of sports never quite clicked with Bailey, shooting hoops with Rob played a huge role in making Kieffer feel like a part of their family. Rob is currently in 9th grade at Summit High School, where he starts at point guard for the varsity basketball team and charms everyone around him with his effortless charisma.
