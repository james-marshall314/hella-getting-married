Venue / Topanga
General Info
The ceremony and reception will be taking place outside, in Los Angeles, in September, so it could be quite warm. We’ll also be dancing well into the evening, however, and it can get quite cold at night in Topanga. So the dress code is basically “look good, don’t stress too much, but don’t show up in a t-shirt.”
Directions
You may be asking yourself, “Why are there directions? Do Kieffer and Bailey not realize it is 2016? Don’t they know we can navigate via cellular phone?” In which case we would like to point out that cell phone service is spotty at best in Topanga, and we do not have to come find you when google craps out on you and you wind up in the state park.
From the Valley:
1. Head west on Topanga Canyon Blvd, with the 101 Freeway at your back
2. You pass Mullholland Dr, your final traffic light. If you don’t do this within 5-10 minutes, you’re going the wrong way.
3. Drive 4.5 miles along Topanga Canyon Blvd, and then turn left on Cheney Dr. If you pass either the Topanga Community House on your left, or the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum on your right, you’ve gone to far.
4. In about half a mile, veer right to stay on Cheney Dr. If the road turns into dirt, you missed the turn
5. In a few thousand feet, Cheney comes to a T at Callon Dr. Turn right on Callon Dr.
6. Your destination will be on the right.
From the Pacific Coast Highway:
1. Head east on Topanga Canyon Blvd, with the ocean at your back
2. Drive 6.4 miles, and then turn right at Cheney Dr. If you pass the Topanga Table on your left, you’ve gone to far.
3. In about half a mile, veer right to stay on Cheney Dr. If the road turns into dirt, you missed the turn.
4. In a few thousand feet, Cheney comes to a T at Callon Dr. Turn right on Callon Dr.
5. Your destination will be on the right. 


Lodging
The most convenient hotels are in Woodland Hills, right at the base of the canyon. There are quite a few options to choose from, covering a range of budgets and levels of luxury. We would recommend staying at one of these options, but feel free to hoe your own row, as it were.
 
Adequate - Knight’s Inn
21706 Ventura Blvd
Woodland Hills, CA 91364
(818) 992-4426


Decent - Best Western
21830 Ventura Boulevard
Woodland Hills, CA, 91364
(818) 340-1000


Good - Courtyard Marriott
21101 Ventura Blvd
Woodland Hills, CA 91364
(818) 999-2200


Maybe Better, But Slightly Further Away - Hilton
6360 Canoga Ave
Woodland Hills, CA, 91367
  
If you prefer a less traditional hospitality experience, AirBnB is particularly good in Topanga. However, there will be another wedding in the canyon that weekend, so if you do decide to go this route we would recommend booking as quickly as possible.
 
Transportation
 
We will be providing a shuttle service from the recommended hotels to and from the ceremony. Uber/Lyft are both quite affordable in LA and will happily take you into the canyon. We would recommend taking Lyft instead of Uber, just because they’re a little bit less soul-crushingly evil, but (insert shruggie).
 
You could also definitely drive to the ceremony, but we wouldn’t recommend it. First of all, there is not that much parking in Topanga, and vendors, immediate family, and a drop off zone for the shuttle will take up a significant portion of what there is.


Further, and 100% more importantly, folks often get drunk at weddings, and it is really not okay to drive drunk in Topanga. Obviously it is not okay to drive drunk anywhere, but after even one or two drinks the canyon can get very dangerous. All of the roads are winding, narrow, and poorly lit, there’s a preponderance of blind curves, and if you mess up a turn you are liable to head straight off a 100+ foot cliff. Please, please do not drive to our wedding if you can at all avoid it.

Our Story
Bailey and Kieffer met in 2007, when they were both freshmen at Colorado College, whereupon she promptly and justifiably decided she disliked him quite a bit. They spent the next three and a half years sharing a large group of mutual friends, saying hi to each other at the dining hall or parties, and otherwise having nothing at all to do with each other. After Kieffer did quite a bit of growing up, including a year off from school and a semester in Greece, they got to talking during the second semester of Bailey’s senior year and the rest, as they say, was history. Sort of.
First, Bailey had to break up with her boyfriend. Then, they had to make it through a full year of Bailey traveling the world while Kieffer stayed behind in Colorado Springs to finish up college. Finally, Kieffer had to convince Bailey to betray every bit of her gentle nature and outdoorsy upbringing and move to New York City with him. Since then, leaving aside unemployment, illnesses in the family, underemployment, late night trips to the emergency room, over-employment, and the occasional vicious mauling by domestic cat, things have been mostly calm.
After three and a half years in NYC, Kieffer finally realized that it wasn’t ever going to get any better than this. Despite going ring shopping together, he managed to surprise Bailey by proposing in LA during Thanksgiving, 2015 (The story of how it all went down is super cute and really meaningful, too. You should ask someone about it). Now, they’re getting ready to take the next big steps in their lives as a team. Bailey is about to finish a masters degree, Kieffer recently started working freelance to give himself time to pursue writing and have more control over his life, and they’re planning a move back to the west coast. What the future holds for these two and the cats they treat like actual human babies remains to be seen, but if we can learn anything from the story so far, it’s likely to be uneventful, unexciting, and proceed exactly as planned.

Wedding Party
Aly met Kieffer in the climbing gym shortly after she transferred to CC and he started his freshman year, meaning their relationship stands as a testament to the value of trying new things, even if you quickly give up on them. Their friendship blossomed quickly, finding fertile soil in their shared love of talking too fast, having too many opinions, being able to dish out looks so withering they could take down the dictator of a small country, and wearing really tight pants. It was as if the universe had found each person’s platonically ideal friend, and ensured they would cross paths. They’re both a lot nicer than they were back then, but like twin stars bound together by destiny, their fates remain inextricably entwined.
